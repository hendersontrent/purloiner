Calculate Time-Series Features from Feature Sets in R and Python

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of `purloiner` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/purloiner")
```

## General purpose

`purloiner` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly access calculate $>1200$ time-series features from a range of existing R and Python packages. The packages which `purloiner` 'steals' features from currently are:

* [catch22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-019-00647-x) (R; [see `Rcatch22` for the native implementation on CRAN](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22))
* [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org) (R)
* [tsfeatures](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures) (R)
* [Kats](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/) (Python)
* [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.com) (Python)
* [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python)

Please note that users should consider using the larger [`theft`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theft/tree/main) (Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series) package on CRAN for access to an entire workflow of functions for feature calculation, processing, visualisation, and statistical analysis. `purloiner` is the feature calculation module of `theft`.

`Kats`, `tsfresh` and `TSFEL` are Python packages. `purloiner` has built-in functionality for helping you install these libraries---all you need to do is install Python 3.9 on your machine. If you wish to access the Python feature sets, please run `?install_python_pkgs` in R after downloading `purloiner` or consult the vignette in the package for more information. For a comprehensive comparison of `catch22`, `feasts`, `tsfeatures`, `Kats`, `tsfresh`, and `TSFEL` across a range of domains (including computation speed, within-set feature composition, and between-set feature correlations), please refer to the paper [An Empirical Evaluation of Time-Series Feature Sets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679937).
